## The Real Story

### 🧑🏻‍💻 Frontend Developer with an unhealthy React obsession

It's still the best framework out there. I will die on this hill.

### 🔪 Bleeding-edge Tech Enthusiast

Always surfing the wave of frontend innovation, implementing new tech _possibly_ before it's ready, and learning valuable lessons along the way. _(No regrets about those production deployments though, maintainers claimed it was "ready for production")_

### 🧑🏻‍🎨 Designer in Recovery

Still paying Adobe Creative Cloud monthly because "you never know when you'll need to make a quick vector logo." _(It's been 8 months since I last opened Illustrator, but who's counting?)_

### 🖨️ Former Business Owner

Armed with an oddly specific expertise in large format printer maintenance and operation that I'll probably never use again. _(But hey, those entrepreneurial skills? Priceless.)_

### 🤓 Certified Code Nerd

The kind of person who watches coding tutorials for entertainment and gets genuinely excited about new TypeScript features. _(I know, I know, I "need better hobbies".)_

### 🤖 AI Hipster

Been following OpenAI since they were teaching bots to destroy Dota 2 pros, back before language models were cool. Watched OpenAI Five crush professional players and tried explaining to friends why a bot mastering last-hits and ward placement was groundbreaking.

### 🐩 The Good Stuff

Proud poodle parent and unashamedly devoted husband. These two keep me grounded when I'm too deep in a JavaScript rabbit hole. They're the reason I remember to look up from ~VS Code~ Zed occasionally.
